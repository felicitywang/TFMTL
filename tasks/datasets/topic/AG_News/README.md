**AG's News Topic Classification Dataset**

**Summary**

The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed from AG, a collection of more than 1 million news articles. News articles have been gathered from more than 2000  news sources by ComeToMyHead in more than 1 year of activity.

The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the dataset above. It is used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

**Basic stats:**
+ \# items = 127,600
+ \# labels = 4
    - 1: World
    - 2: Sports
    - 3: Business
    - 4: Sci/Tech


**Basic Unit**: document

** Split: train : test = 120,000 : 7,600 **
